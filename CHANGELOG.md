## [0.9.2] - Unreleased

Schema evolution for local-first data: tolerant **validate-on-import** and
application **schema migrations**, both wired on **browser (OPFS worker) and
Node.js**. Ships rebuilt `.node` and WASM binaries.

### Added

- **Validate-on-import — "validate, never cast" inside `db.sync()`** — attach a tolerant `syncSchema` to a collection and every document pulled by `db.sync()` is checked in the engine before the Last-Write-Wins merge, instead of being cast in blindly. The core `import_changes` path now consults an `ImportValidator` whose decision is one of *accept / coerce / skip / **quarantine*** — it **never hard-rejects** (a local-first, LWW replica that dropped or threw on a foreign-shaped document would lose a legitimately newer write or diverge peers). Rejected documents are set aside in a per-collection quarantine table, recoverable via `db.quarantined(collection)` (`{ document, reason, changedAt }`), never dropped and never aborting the batch. `SyncSchema` is structural — `{ version, required, types, defaults }` — the tolerant safety net on the boundary you don't control, distinct from the strict Zod/Valibot `schema` that still runs on the local `insert` path. Wired on **browser and Node**; React Native falls back to unvalidated import until its binding carries the plumbing. See [Schema & Sync Standards](https://taladb.dev/guide/schema-and-sync-standards).
- **Per-document schema version (`_v`)** — a document tagged `_v` **below** its collection's `syncSchema.version` is upgraded in place on import (field **renames** applied, missing `defaults` filled, `_v` stamped) rather than rejected — additive-only migration that travels *with the data*, so peers on different app versions converge. A document `_v` **ahead** of the local version is accepted untouched (the peer is ahead, not wrong). The counter is per-document and independent of the engine's own storage-schema version.
- **`syncSchema.renames` — structural field renames on import** — `{ syncSchema: { version, renames: { oldName: 'newName' } } }` moves a value from an old field name to a new one when upgrading a below-version document, in the engine, before defaults. The deterministic, structural half of schema evolution (browser + Node); pairs with `migrateDocument` for renames that need computation.
- **`migrateDocument` — lazy read-time normalization (all runtimes)** — a per-collection `migrateDocument(doc, fromVersion)` on `db.collection(name, { syncSchema: { version }, migrateDocument })`. Every document returned by `find` / `findOne` whose `_v` is below `syncSchema.version` is passed through the callback and stamped to the current version before the app sees it — so code always reads the current shape (computed/derived fields, splits/merges), even for documents that predate the schema. It's a pure client-side transform, so it works on **every runtime** with no binding support, and complements the structural, import-time `syncSchema` (the RxDB lazy-migration model). The transform applies to the returned value only (not persisted back); pair with `openDB({ migrations })` or `syncSchema.renames` to rewrite stored documents eagerly.
- **Application schema migrations — `openDB({ migrations })`** *(browser + Node)* — pass an ordered `migrations: [{ version, description?, up }]` array and TalaDB runs the pending ones (version greater than the stored counter) at open, in ascending order. The stored version — a new `meta::user_version` counter, kept separate from the engine's storage-schema version — advances **after each `up` resolves** (checkpoint per version): a migration that throws stops the run and the error propagates, and the next open resumes from the one that failed. This is checkpoint-per-version, **not** whole-batch-atomic (a single `up` runs through the normal collection API, so write bodies must be idempotent — `createIndex` already is). Node runs it via the napi binding; the browser runs it in the OPFS worker. React Native throws a clear "not available on this binary" error until its JSI HostObject exposes the version accessors (the Rust FFI is in place). See [Migrations](https://taladb.dev/api/migrations).
- **`SyncResult.skipped` / `SyncResult.quarantined`** — a validated sync pass now reports how many pulled documents an import validator skipped (a collection this client doesn't model) or quarantined (failed structural validation). Both optional and additive — unset when no `syncSchema` applied.
- **Native binding accessors** — `@taladb/node` and `@taladb/web` expose `userVersion()` / `setUserVersion(v)` (backing the migration runner) and `importChangesValidated(changeset, schemas)` / `quarantined(collection)` (backing validated sync). The React Native Rust FFI gains `taladb_user_version` / `taladb_set_user_version` (JSI glue pending).

### Fixed

- **Docs — the Migrations API page documented a feature that did not exist** — `openDB({ migrations })` was fully documented (with a false "single atomic transaction" guarantee) but never implemented; passing `migrations` was silently ignored. It is now implemented (see above) and the page rewritten to the real per-version-checkpoint semantics, with an idempotency note.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **`@taladb/react` — scoped replication hooks (`useQuery`, `useQueries`, `useMutation`)** — a react-query-shaped surface that binds a component to a *slice* of a remote origin, on demand, instead of the global-and-imperative `db.sync()`. The local store is a durable **replica, not a cache**: a pull writes into the real local collection and the existing live query re-renders off it (one-way data flow — no `queryKey`, no `invalidateQueries`, because writing to the collection *is* the invalidation). Built on the existing sync-contract transport (`db.sync()` / `HttpSyncAdapter`), so it inherits tombstones, cursors, and Last-Write-Wins. `useQuery` supports `source` modes (`local-first` / `remote-first` / `local-only`) and a `pollMs` refresh interval; `useQueries` runs several slices in parallel; `useMutation` writes local-first then replicates out through a bounded-retry drain (write-behind — the local write is never rolled back). Writes are origin-authoritative by default. Authorization is a provider-level async resolver (`getAuth`) resolved at **send time**, so an offline write flushed later carries a current token. Strictly typed end to end — remote data is validated against the collection schema, never cast. Configured via a new `<ReplicationProvider>` composed inside `<TalaDBProvider>`. Verified by 28 unit tests plus a real end-to-end run (two Node databases + a live sync server proving the pull → local → live-query loop). Sync is Node-wired today; the browser and React Native bindings ride the same code as they land. See [Scoped Replication](https://taladb.dev/guide/scoped-replication).
- **`@taladb/react` — `prefetch` (background first-run warming)** — a `<ReplicationProvider prefetch={['products', …]}>` option that warms slices into the local replica in the background, so a later `useQuery` reads local instead of waiting on the network. Off the critical path: deferred to browser idle (`requestIdleCallback`), run in the sync Worker on web, bounded by `prefetchConcurrency` (default 2), and coalesced with any concurrent `useQuery` for the same collection via in-flight dedup. First-run only by default (`prefetchMode: 'once'`, gated on the sync cursor so returning users don't re-warm); best-effort and silent on failure. See [Scoped Replication → Warming the replica on first run](https://taladb.dev/guide/scoped-replication).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-11

Bidirectional sync lands in the browser — a local-first web app can now
`db.sync()` against any backend — and five bugs found while wiring it are
fixed, including two that broke 0.8.4's Node sync and `openDB` entirely.
Ships rebuilt `.node` and WASM binaries.

### Performance

- **Flat vector search is ~2× faster** — the brute-force `findNearest` scan was rewritten: it scores directly from stored bytes (removing one `Vec<f32>` heap allocation per vector per query — ~100k/query at scale), hoists the query's cosine norm out of the per-candidate loop, selects the top-k with `select_nth_unstable` instead of a full sort, and resolves a hybrid pre-filter to an id set *before* scanning so filtered-out vectors are never scored. Measured on the benchmark laptop: 100k × 384-dim from 369 ms → ~197 ms, 10k from 40 ms → ~18 ms, 100k hybrid from 448 ms → ~326 ms. No API or result change.
- **Two-sided range queries use a bounded index scan** — `find({ field: { $gte: a, $lt: b } })` on an indexed field previously scanned from the lower bound to the end of the index and post-filtered the upper bound; the planner now emits a single bounded range scan. A ~100-doc `publishedAt` window at 100k docs dropped from ~463 ms to **0.76 ms** (~600×). The bounded plan covers both Int- and Float-typed index entries, with a cross-type parity test asserting it matches the unindexed result exactly.
- Next perf levers (in-memory decoded-vector cache; SIMD — a `+simd128` WASM build was measured to ~halve browser vector search) are on the [roadmap](https://taladb.dev/roadmap).

### Added

- **Encryption at rest on all three runtimes** — AES-GCM-256 encryption, previously Node.js/React-Native only, now works in the **browser** too. Pass `openDB(name, { passphrase })` and the OPFS-backed storage is wrapped in the same `EncryptedBackend` used natively (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 600k iterations; 16-byte salt in an OPFS sidecar managed by the worker). Verified end-to-end in real headless Chrome: the on-disk OPFS bytes contain no plaintext, the correct passphrase round-trips, and a wrong passphrase is rejected. Browser encryption **fails closed** — if OPFS is unavailable it refuses to open rather than silently using a plaintext fallback — and is single-tab (the multi-tab IndexedDB-snapshot fallback stores decrypted plaintext, so it's refused for encrypted databases). Document IDs and index keys remain unencrypted by design (they must stay comparable).
- **Compound (multi-field) indexes — `collection.createCompoundIndex(fields)` / `dropCompoundIndex(fields)`** — the core engine's compound-index support (storage, planner, write-time maintenance, migration rebuild) is now exposed through the bindings. The query planner uses a compound index for an `$and` where every indexed field is constrained by equality — one index scan instead of a full-collection scan. Available on **Node.js and the browser** (OPFS worker + in-memory), verified by the core test suite and a native e2e; **React Native** is wired through the FFI + JSI HostObject but pending on-device verification (same status as RN sync). Ascending, equality-on-all-fields today; partial-prefix / trailing-range / per-field-descending are on the [roadmap](https://taladb.dev/roadmap).
- **`db.sync()` in the browser** — both browser adapters (OPFS worker and the in-memory fallback) now wire the full bidirectional sync loop. All engine work (change export, LWW merge) runs inside the Dedicated Worker, off the main thread, so a sync pass never blocks rendering regardless of changeset size. Verified end-to-end against a real Chrome instance: browser ↔ HTTP sync server ↔ Node.js peer, with changeset format parity in both directions.
- **`db.sync()` on React Native — implemented, pending on-device verification** — the changeset primitives (`exportChanges` / `importChanges` / `listCollectionNames`) are now exposed through the full RN stack: Rust FFI (`taladb_export_changes` / `taladb_import_changes` / `taladb_list_collection_names`), the C header, and the JSI HostObject (C++). The TS adapter feature-detects them and enables the same `db.sync()` used on Node/web, falling back to a clear error on native modules that predate them. The Rust FFI and TS layers are compiled/typechecked here; the JSI native glue has **not** yet been built or exercised on a device or simulator — that verification (iOS + Android) is required before RN sync is considered shipped.
- **`@taladb/web` — `TalaDBWasm.listCollectionNames()`** — user collection names (reserved names excluded), backing the sync orchestration's "sync all" default on the in-memory browser path.
- **`@taladb/next` — first-party Next.js integration** — `@taladb/next/server` exposes `createSyncHandlers({ store, authorize })`: a complete sync backend as a pair of fetch-style route handlers implementing the `HttpSyncAdapter` contract, with per-caller scope partitioning via `authorize` (401 on rejection) and changeset validation. Two built-in stores: `memorySyncStore()` (dev/tests) and `taladbSyncStore(db)` — a server-side TalaDB as the change hub, same LWW layout as `@taladb/sync-mongodb`. `@taladb/next/client` exposes `<SyncProvider endpoint interval>`: the start/interval/reconnect/tab-focus sync cadence as a drop-in component composing with `<TalaDBProvider>`. Handlers are framework-agnostic (standard `Request`/`Response`), verified end-to-end from a real Chrome client through the built package.
- **`@taladb/react` — drop-in Next.js support** — the build output now ships the `'use client'` directive (SWR/react-query convention), and `<TalaDBProvider name="myapp.db" fallback={…}>` is a new name-based form where the provider owns the `openDB` lifecycle: opens lazily on the client (never during SSR), renders `fallback` until ready so hooks never observe a missing instance, closes on unmount (StrictMode-safe). The existing `db`-prop form is unchanged.
- **`examples/nextjs-sync`** — a complete local-first Next.js app: on-device notes with live queries, `<TalaDBProvider name>` + `<SyncProvider>` on the client, and a one-call `createSyncHandlers` route as the backend. CI now runs a real `next build` over it, so bundler-level regressions across the whole client stack fail the build. Release workflow publishes `@taladb/next` alongside the other packages.
- **End-to-end sync test suite (`tests/sync.e2e.test.ts`)** — exercises `openDB` → native engine → cursor persistence → `HttpSyncAdapter` against a real HTTP server, with LWW-convergence and incremental-cursor assertions. Skips automatically when the native module isn't built. The existing unit tests mock the engine and could not catch any of the bugs below.

### Fixed

- **Browser — a failed `openDB` locked the OPFS database until page reload** — when the worker's open threw (wrong encryption passphrase, storage error), the exclusive `FileSystemSyncAccessHandle` was never closed and the zombie worker was never terminated, so every retry failed with "Access Handles cannot be created". The worker now closes the handle on a failed open (releasing the Web Lock with it) and the client terminates the worker when `init` rejects — so a user who mistypes a passphrase can simply retry. Verified in headless Chrome (wrong passphrase → correct passphrase retry succeeds in the same page). Latent in all released versions for any failed browser open; made routine by encryption's retryable wrong-passphrase path.
- **Browser — encrypted databases now ignore cross-tab `secondary-write` messages** — the BroadcastChannel handler that merges secondary-tab changesets accepted any nonempty token; since encrypted databases are single-tab by design, this was pure injection surface (a same-origin script could add documents to an encrypted DB without the passphrase). Encrypted mode now drops these messages. Also, the key-derivation salt sidecar is now read/created only after the tab wins the exclusive lock, removing a rare two-tab race on the salt file's access handle.
- **`taladb-core` — the sync cursor collection was rejected as a reserved name** — `db.sync()`'s first pass threw `InvalidName`: the cursor store `__taladb_sync` starts with `_`, which collection-name validation reserves, and no exemption existed. The validator now has an explicit addressable-system-collection allowlist (`__taladb_sync` only); `_audit` and all other `_`-prefixed names stay blocked, and the cursor store stays hidden from `listCollectionNames()`. **This broke 0.8.4 bidirectional sync on every runtime.**
- **`taladb` — `openDB()` was broken on Node.js** — the client destructured `TalaDBNode` from `@taladb/node`, but napi-rs normalizes the Rust struct name to the JS class `TalaDbNode`, so the published 0.8.4 client read `undefined` and crashed on open. A hand-written type alias in the generated `.d.ts` masked the mismatch from the type checker. The client now accepts both names and fails with a clear message if neither exists.
- **Sync cursors were never found after being written** — the cursor document used a caller-supplied `_id: target`, but the engine assigns ULIDs and ignores caller-supplied ids, and the `_id` fast path treats non-ULID strings as matching nothing. Every pass therefore read `sinceMs = 0` (full re-sync, safe but O(all-data) forever) and inserted a fresh orphan cursor document. Cursors are now keyed by a regular `target` field.
- **Pull cursor could permanently skip late-arriving remote changes** — a single local-wall-clock watermark filtered remote changes by their author-time `changed_at`: a change authored before your last sync but arriving at the server after it was never fetched again. Cursors are now split — `pushMs` (local clock, for exports) and `pullMs` (the newest remote `changed_at` actually received) — so late arrivals stay fetchable. Clock skew between peers still affects LWW conflict resolution itself; a server-assigned sequence cursor is on the roadmap as the fully robust design.
- **`taladb` — the browser bundle broke webpack/Next.js builds** — `dist/index.browser.mjs` contained the unreachable `import('@taladb/node')` from the Node adapter; webpack resolves every literal dynamic import, so builds either chased the native `.node` binary into the browser graph (workspace/monorepo setups) or failed with "Can't resolve '@taladb/node'" (apps that rightly don't install it). The browser build now inlines a stub for the specifier — the same treatment the React Native build already applied for Metro. Caught by the new `next build` CI job over the example app.
- **`HttpSyncAdapter` threw `Illegal invocation` in browsers** — it stored `globalThis.fetch` detached; browsers require `fetch` to be called on its global. The adapter now binds it (Node tolerated the detached call, which is why only browser use broke).

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-11

Bidirectional sync arrives: a local TalaDB can now pull remote changes and push
local ones with Last-Write-Wins merge, plus a first-party MongoDB adapter and a
MongoDB-style aggregation pipeline API on every runtime.

### Added

- **Bidirectional sync — `db.sync(adapter, { collections, direction })`** *(Node.js)* — pulls remote changes into the local database and pushes local ones, tracked by a persisted incremental cursor, with automatic Last-Write-Wins conflict resolution. `direction` is `'both'` (default), `'push'`, or `'pull'`. Built on two new low-level primitives exposed across the bindings — `db.exportChanges(collections, sinceMs)` and `db.importChanges(changeset)` (idempotent under LWW, so replays and at-least-once transports are safe). The local changeset is snapshotted before the remote import, so a change just pulled is never echoed back. Cursors live in a reserved `__taladb_sync` collection (hidden from `listCollectionNames`, never itself synced). See [Bidirectional Sync](https://taladb.dev/guide/bidirectional-sync). *Browser (WASM) and React Native share the same engine and API; their binding wiring is in progress and `db.sync()` throws a clear error there until it lands.*
- **`SyncAdapter` interface + reference `HttpSyncAdapter`** — any transport becomes a sync peer by implementing `push(changeset)` / `pull(sinceMs)`. `HttpSyncAdapter` (a `POST /push` + `GET /pull?since=` REST client) ships inside the `taladb` package with zero extra dependencies — the batteries-included default.
- **Aggregation API — `collection.aggregate(pipeline)`** *(all runtimes)* — MongoDB-style pipeline stages `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, `$skip`, `$limit`, `$project` with `$sum`, `$count`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, `$push`, `$addToSet`, `$first`, `$last` accumulators. Summaries are computed inside the Rust engine in a single pass — a leading `$match` uses an index — instead of materialising every document in JavaScript. Fully typed via `AggregatePipeline<T>`. See [Aggregation](https://taladb.dev/api/aggregation).
- **`@taladb/sync-mongodb` — MongoDB sync adapter** — syncs directly to a MongoDB collection with no intermediate API. Push does a Last-Write-Wins conditional upsert (a `$cond` pipeline update — correct even when several peers push the same document out of order); pull returns changes newer than the caller's cursor. Doubles as a lightweight sync hub for a fleet of peers. Document bodies are stored as opaque JSON, so field names containing `$` or `.` never collide with MongoDB operators. **Server-side only** — it holds a database credential, so run it on a Node.js backend; browser/mobile apps sync through your own API. See [Bidirectional Sync → MongoDB adapter](https://taladb.dev/guide/bidirectional-sync#mongodb-adapter).

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-09

Published benchmarks and a Node.js vector-index fix. Ships a rebuilt `.node`
binary — `@taladb/node` gains HNSW support.

### Fixed

- **`@taladb/node` — HNSW vector indexes were silently unavailable** — the prebuilt native module was compiled without the `vector-hnsw` feature, so `createVectorIndex(..., { indexType: 'hnsw' })` and `upgradeVectorIndex()` were silent no-ops and every `findNearest` ran the flat (brute-force) path regardless of the requested index type. The published binary now compiles with `vector-hnsw`; measured at 50k × 384-dim vectors, HNSW answers in 14.6 ms vs 188 ms flat, with 100% recall@10 on clustered (embedding-like) test vectors — see the benchmarks page for the recall and graph-build-cost caveats. (Web and React Native binaries still ship flat-only; enabling HNSW there is tracked separately — WASM size and mobile memory need evaluation first.)

### Added

- **Benchmark suite — `scripts/bench.mjs` (`pnpm bench`)** — reproducible benchmarks against the release `@taladb/node` build: document write throughput (single vs batched), query latency at 100k documents (point get, indexed equality/range, full scan), and vector search at 1k–100k × 384-dim vectors (flat and HNSW, including hybrid pre-filtered search and recall measurement). Deterministic seeded data, medians after warmup.
- **Browser benchmark suite — `scripts/bench-web.mjs` (`pnpm bench:web`)** — the same workload against `@taladb/web` in real headless Chrome with OPFS active, driven over the worker message protocol with no automation dependency (the page reports results back over HTTP). Confirms WASM vector search at parity with native and documents the browser's debounced-snapshot durability model.
- **Docs — `/benchmarks` page** — full result tables for both runtimes, methodology, and tuning guidance (batch your writes, index your hybrid filter fields, prefer one-sided indexed ranges), plus a performance summary in the README.

### Known limitations (documented, not new)

- Two-sided indexed ranges (`$gte` + `$lt` on the same field) use the index for the lower bound only and post-filter the rest; the greedy planner does not yet emit bounded range plans.
- `findNearest` pre-filters materialise full documents (including embedding fields) to collect matching ids; an id-only path would make hybrid queries cheaper.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-12

Hardening: sync data-loss fixes, query
correctness on mixed numeric types, security fixes in Studio and the bindings,
and a real live-query API. Ship the npm packages and the prebuilt `.node` /
WASM artifacts together — the JS↔native surface changed in this release.

### Security

- **`taladb-cli` — Studio bound to `0.0.0.0` with no authentication** — anyone on the local network could browse and **delete** documents. Studio now binds `127.0.0.1` by default (new `--host` flag opts out, with a loud warning) and validates the `Host` header against DNS-rebinding attacks, returning `403` for requests carrying a foreign hostname.
- **`@taladb/react-native` — malformed filters silently became match-all** — `parse_filter` degraded any unparseable filter (e.g. a typo'd operator like `{"status":{"$qe":"x"}}`) to `Filter::All`, so a malformed filter passed to `deleteMany`/`updateMany` destroyed or rewrote the **entire collection**. Invalid filters now error through the FFI `taladb_last_error` channel at every call site, and a malformed `findNearest` pre-filter errors instead of silently running an unfiltered search.
- **`taladb-core` — field-level encryption AAD now bound to the document** — ciphertexts were bound to the field name only, so an attacker with write access to the file could transplant doc A's encrypted `ssn` into doc B undetected. New ciphertexts use `field:<doc_id>:<field>` AAD; reads fall back to the legacy field-only AAD so existing data stays readable and upgrades on its next write.
- **`taladb-core` — ULID generation no longer ignores entropy failure** — a failing system RNG previously produced ULIDs with a zeroed random field (predictable, collision-prone); it now panics with a clear message.

### Fixed

- **`taladb-core` — sync: updates propagated to peers as deletions** — applying a remote upsert (LWW), a CRDT merge, or `CrdtSyncAdapter::update_fields` replaced documents via `delete_by_id` + `insert_with_id`, leaving a delete tombstone newer than the document itself. The next export emitted a `Delete` that destroyed the updated document on every peer. All three paths now use the new atomic `Collection::replace_with_id`, which maintains indexes against the previous version and clears the tombstone. Covered by new update → export → import → export → import round-trip tests for both adapters.
- **`taladb-core` — LWW `Delete` import ignored timestamps** — a stale remote tombstone unconditionally deleted a newer local document. Deletions now apply only when `changed_at` is at least as new as the local `_changed_at` (deletes win exact ties), and stale upserts can no longer resurrect a more recently deleted document (tombstone timestamp is checked before re-inserting).
- **`taladb-core` — LWW equal-timestamp conflicts permanently diverged** — the tie-break compared `change.id > local_doc.id`, which is the *same* ULID, so it was always false and each replica kept its own version. Ties now break on the serialized document bytes — a symmetric comparison every replica resolves identically.
- **`taladb-core` — indexed numeric range queries missed cross-type values** — index keys are type-prefixed (`Int` sorts below `Float`), but filters compare Int↔Float numerically. `$lt`/`$lte` with an Int bound never scanned the Float block (and `$gt`/`$gte` with a Float bound never scanned Ints), so `{price: {$lt: 11}}` on an indexed field silently missed `10.5` — the default situation from JavaScript, where `10` maps to Int and `10.5` to Float. The planner now unions a conservatively-widened range of the other numeric type; indexed and unindexed results are asserted identical by new parity tests. Also fixes `$eq` on `0.0` missing stored `-0.0` (and vice versa).
- **`taladb-core` — stale per-handle index cache corrupted indexes** — each `Database::collection()` call got its own index-definition cache, so creating an index through one handle left every other live handle unaware: their writes skipped maintaining the new index forever. The cache is now shared per `Database`, keyed by collection.
- **`taladb-core` — TOCTOU race in filtered mutations** — `update_one/many` and `delete_one/many` gathered candidates in a read snapshot, then mutated in a separate write transaction using the stale documents, losing concurrent updates and leaking stale index entries. Every candidate is now re-fetched and re-checked against the filter inside the exclusive write transaction.
- **`taladb-core` — storage errors during index-definition loading were swallowed** — `unwrap_or_default()` treated transient read errors as "no indexes", silently skipping index maintenance on writes. Errors now propagate (only a genuinely missing table maps to empty).
- **`taladb-core` — encryption: v0→v1 migration could permanently destroy ~1/256 of values** — a v0 ciphertext whose random nonce happens to start with `0x01` was misdetected as already-v1 and skipped; once the rest of the table migrated, it became undecryptable. Migration now verifies "looks like v1" values with an actual decrypt before skipping.
- **`taladb-core` — `find_by_id` and `find_nearest` returned ciphertext for encrypted fields** — both now decrypt configured fields like `find` does; `replace_with_id` re-encrypts symmetrically.
- **`taladb-core` — audit log was not atomic with its mutation** — audit rows were written in a separate transaction after commit: a crash could persist the mutation without its audit row, and an audit error returned `Err` for an already-committed write. Audit rows now commit inside the mutation's own transaction.
- **`taladb-core` — `$in` with duplicate values returned duplicate documents** — adjacent-only `Vec::dedup` missed interleaved ULIDs from identical ranges; now deduplicated with a set.
- **`taladb-core` — `$inc` arithmetic** — i64 overflow now errors instead of wrapping in release builds; `Float += Int` works (previously a `TypeError` while `Int += Float` succeeded); a non-numeric `$inc` delta is rejected.
- **`taladb-core` — `rekey` could not recover from an interrupted run** — each table commits separately, so a partial run left mixed keys and a re-run failed on its own progress. Values that already decrypt under the new key are now skipped, making `rekey` safely re-runnable.
- **`taladb-core` — `Document` accepted duplicate field names** — `get`/`set` only ever saw the first occurrence, but all duplicates serialized to storage. Duplicates are now dropped at construction (first occurrence wins).
- **`taladb-core` — HNSW results shrank below `top_k` after deletions** — deleted ids linger in the in-memory graph and were filtered out of results without replacement. The HNSW path now over-fetches to compensate, and the staleness contract (rebuild via `upgrade_vector_index` after bulk writes) is documented on `find_nearest`.
- **`taladb` — `useFind` stuck on `loading: true` for empty collections** — the browser `subscribe` initialized its change-detection state to `'[]'`, so an initially-empty result was never delivered. First snapshot now always fires.
- **`taladb` — WorkerProxy promises hung forever if the worker died** — in-flight requests are now rejected on `worker.onerror` and on `close()`, and new requests fail fast once the proxy is dead.
- **`@taladb/web` — HTTP sync events could arrive out of order** — one concurrent `fetch` per event let retries reorder deliveries (an update could reach the endpoint before its insert). Events now drain through a strict FIFO queue.
- **`taladb-core` — watch notifications could be silently skipped under lock contention** — `notify` used `try_lock`; a committed write that lost the race never woke its watchers. Now takes the lock.
- **`@taladb/react-native` — `listIndexes()` returned a malformed empty object**; now returns the correct `{ btree: [], fts: [], vector: [] }` shape.

### Added

- **`taladb-core` — `Collection::watch(filter)`: live queries in the Rust core** — the previously-unwired `watch` module is now connected to every write path. A `WatchHandle` yields a fresh snapshot of matching documents after each insert/update/delete, across all handles of the same `Database` (one registry per collection). Rapid writes coalesce; the query re-runs at receive time so no state is ever skipped.
- **`taladb-core` — `Collection::replace_with_id(doc)`** — atomic insert-or-replace preserving the ULID: maintains all indexes against the previous version, clears any delete tombstone, and re-encrypts configured fields. The building block used by both sync adapters.
- **`taladb-core` / `@taladb/web` — explicit `removed_fields` in update sync payloads** — `SyncEvent::Update` now carries a `removed` list and HTTP payloads include `"removed_fields": [...]`, disambiguating "field removed" from "field set to null". Nulls are still emitted in `changes` for older receivers.
- **`@taladb/node` — `close()` and async write variants** — `close()` releases the database file handle/lock; `insertAsync`, `insertManyAsync`, `updateOneAsync`, `updateManyAsync`, `deleteOneAsync`, `deleteManyAsync` run on the libuv thread pool instead of blocking the event loop. The universal `taladb` adapter routes through them automatically, falling back to the sync calls on older prebuilt binaries.
- **Operator parity across bindings** — `$contains` and `$regex` on Node, `$regex` on web (both previously unreachable from those platforms despite core support).
- **`taladb-core` — `_id` primary-key fast path** — `$eq`/`$in` filters on `_id` (including inside `$and`) now resolve to direct point lookups instead of a full collection scan.
- **`taladb-cli` — `taladb studio --host <addr>`** — explicit opt-in for non-loopback binding (see Security).

### Changed

- **Breaking: `{field: {}}` (empty operator object) is now an error on every binding** — previously it errored on Node but silently matched **all documents** on web and React Native. `{}` / `null` as the whole filter still mean match-all.
- **Breaking: collection names starting with `_` are reserved** — `db.collection("_audit")` now returns `InvalidName`, enforcing the audit log's append-only guarantee. System collections are also excluded from `list_collection_names()` / `listCollections()` / Studio.
- **Breaking: an audit-log write failure now fails (rolls back) the mutation** — previously the mutation committed and the API returned an error anyway, inviting duplicate retries.
- **Performance** — `count(filter)` no longer decrypts field contents; mutations no longer open an extra write transaction per call to ensure the `_changed_at` index; `HttpSyncHook` builds its exclude-field set once instead of per event; `useFind`-style pollers are unchanged but cross-tab writes still nudge immediately via BroadcastChannel.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **`taladb-core` — `CrdtSyncAdapter`: conflict-free multi-device sync with per-field logical clocks** — new `crdt` module implementing bidirectional CRDT-based sync that merges concurrent writes at field granularity rather than whole-document LWW. Two devices can independently write different fields of the same document; both changes survive after sync with no coordination required.

  - **`FieldClock { ts_ms, node_id }`** — per-field logical clock. `dominates()` compares timestamp first; `node_id` lexicographic order breaks ties deterministically across any number of replicas.
  - **`FieldMutation { field, value, clock }`** — single field-level change exported from one replica. `value: None` signals field removal.
  - **`CrdtChange { collection, id, mutations, delete_clock }`** — document-level change record. Either a set of field mutations or a delete (mutually exclusive). Deletions are propagated as tombstones via the same mechanism used by `LastWriteWins`.
  - **`CrdtChangeset = Vec<CrdtChange>`** — the serialisable unit exchanged between peers; no transport is prescribed.
  - **`CrdtAdapter` trait** — `export_crdt_changes(db, collections, since_ms)` / `import_crdt_changes(db, changeset)`.
  - **`CrdtSyncAdapter`** — concrete implementation of `CrdtAdapter`:
    - `new(node_id)` — construct with a stable per-device string identifier.
    - `with_g_set_fields(fields)` — opt specific array fields into grow-only set (G-Set) semantics: merges by union rather than LWW, so concurrent adds from any replica are always preserved.
    - `stamp_insert(fields)` / `stamp_insert_at(fields, ts_ms)` — prepare fields for a CRDT-tracked insert; stamps every non-system field with a per-field clock under `_crdt_clocks` and adds `_changed_at`.
    - `update_fields(col, id, changes)` / `update_fields_at(col, id, changes, ts_ms)` — load a document, advance clocks only for the changed fields, and write back atomically. Required for CRDT tracking on updates (replaces `col.update_one` in CRDT-aware write paths).
  - **Clock storage** — clocks are stored inline in each document as `_crdt_clocks: Object({ field: { t: ts_ms, n: node_id } })`. No schema migrations, no new storage tables. Fully compatible with databases that also use `LastWriteWins`.
  - **Export** — uses the existing `_changed_at` secondary index for an O(log N) range scan. Only exports field mutations whose individual clock is newer than `since_ms`, so incremental sync transfers the minimum necessary data.
  - **Import / merge** — for each incoming `CrdtChange`: loads the local document (or creates a new one if absent), compares per-field clocks, applies only the fields where the remote clock dominates, updates `_crdt_clocks` and `_changed_at`, then writes the merged document back. Documents not touched by the changeset are left completely untouched.
  - All public types re-exported from the crate root: `CrdtAdapter`, `CrdtChange`, `CrdtChangeset`, `CrdtSyncAdapter`, `FieldClock`, `FieldMutation`, `CRDT_CLOCKS_FIELD`.
  - 21 new integration tests in `tests/crdt.rs` covering: `stamp_insert` metadata shape, `update_fields_at` partial clock advance, concurrent writes to different fields, same-field conflict (newer wins / older loses), timestamp-tie tiebreaking by `node_id`, field removal, G-Set union, G-Set deduplication, delete ordering, export `since_ms` filtering, export → import round-trip, and three-way merge.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`taladb` — `import.meta` crash in Metro/Hermes** — `dist/index.react-native.mjs` contained `import.meta.url` references from `createBrowserDB` and `createInMemoryBrowserDB`, which are dead code on React Native but were still included in the bundle. Hermes does not support `import.meta` syntax and threw `SyntaxError: import.meta is not supported in Hermes`. Added an esbuild `define` in the react-native tsup build to replace all `import.meta.url` occurrences at compile time.

- **`taladb` — Metro bundling failure: `@taladb/node` could not be resolved** — `createNodeDB` contains a dynamic `import('@taladb/node')` that is dead code on React Native, but Metro resolves every `import()` specifier statically even in unreachable branches. Because `@taladb/node` is an optional peer dependency, tsup automatically externalised it, leaving the specifier in the output for Metro to fail on. Fixed by adding `noExternal: ['@taladb/node']` to the react-native tsup config and using an esbuild `onResolve` plugin to redirect `@taladb/node` to an inline stub that Metro can bundle without error.

- **`taladb` — `openDB` routed to browser adapter on React Native New Architecture** — `detectPlatform()` checked `nativeCallSyncHook` first to detect React Native, but this global is no longer set in RN New Architecture (0.71+). Because React Native also exposes `window` and `navigator`, the function fell through to the browser branch and called `createBrowserDB`, which immediately crashed on the missing `Worker` global. Fixed by checking `navigator.product === 'ReactNative'` first — the canonical, version-stable React Native detection.

- **`taladb` — `createNativeDB` called non-existent `collection()` method on JSI HostObject** — the `NativeHostObject` interface modelled the JSI HostObject as a nested API (`native.collection('notes').insert(doc)`), but the actual C++ HostObject (`TalaDBHostObject.cpp`) exposes a flat API where every method takes the collection name as its first argument (`native.insert('notes', doc)`). Every collection operation threw `native.collection is not a function`. Rewrote `createNativeDB` and its `NativeDB` interface to match the actual flat JSI surface.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`@taladb/react-native` — Android `dlopen` crash: `library libtaladb_ffi.so not found`** — `cargo ndk` builds Rust cdylib files without a SONAME. CMake's `SHARED IMPORTED` + `IMPORTED_LOCATION` recorded the full build-time path in `DT_NEEDED`, so the dynamic linker searched for a path like `../../../../src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libtaladb_ffi.so` at runtime instead of the simple `libtaladb_ffi.so` soname. Fixed by replacing the `SHARED IMPORTED` target with `link_directories()` pointing at the ABI-specific jniLibs folder and linking by name (`-ltaladb_ffi`), which produces `DT_NEEDED: libtaladb_ffi.so` and lets the Android linker find the library via its standard search path.

- **`@taladb/react-native` — `TalaDBModule.kt` was missing `apply plugin: "kotlin-android"`** — without the Kotlin plugin, Gradle could not compile the module's Kotlin source and the package class (`TalaDBPackage`) was never available. Added the plugin to `android/build.gradle`.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`@taladb/react-native` — C++ compilation crash in `taladb.h`** — a nested `/* ... */` block comment on line 195 caused the compiler to terminate the outer comment early and attempt to parse the remaining documentation as C++ code, producing `expected unqualified-id` and `unknown type name` errors. Changed the inner comment to a `//` line comment.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`@taladb/react-native` — Android STL mismatch** — React Native 0.76+ requires the shared C++ runtime (`c++_shared`). Without `ANDROID_STL=c++_shared` in the CMake arguments, the build system defaulted to the static STL, which is incompatible with Hermes and the TurboModule infrastructure. Added `arguments "-DANDROID_STL=c++_shared"` to `android/build.gradle`.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`@taladb/react-native` — Android module never compiled into the app** — `android/build.gradle` was missing. Without it, Gradle did not treat `android/` as a library module — `TalaDBModule.kt` was never compiled and CMake was never invoked to build `libtaladb_jsi.so`. This was the root cause of the `TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing('TalaDB'): 'TalaDB' could not be found` crash on Android.

- **`@taladb/react-native` — TurboModule codegen never ran** — `codegenConfig` was missing from `package.json`. React Native's Gradle plugin reads this field to generate `NativeTalaDBSpec` — the base class `TalaDBModule.kt` extends. Without it, the Kotlin code could not compile even when `build.gradle` was present.

- **`@taladb/react-native` — missing `AndroidManifest.xml`** — added `android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, required for Gradle to recognise the `android/` directory as a valid Android library module.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **`taladb` — React Native installs pulled in `@taladb/web` and `@taladb/node`** — both packages were declared as `optionalDependencies`, which package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm) install by default. Moved to optional `peerDependencies` so only the adapter the consumer actually needs is installed. **Breaking:** web and Node.js users must now explicitly install `@taladb/web` or `@taladb/node` alongside `taladb` (the docs have always shown this; the auto-install was the anomaly).

- **`taladb` — Metro bundler resolved the wrong entry point** — added a `react-native` export condition pointing to a dedicated build (`dist/index.react-native.mjs`). Metro now resolves this entry instead of the default Node.js ESM build, preventing it from statically analysing or bundling `@taladb/web` or `@taladb/node` imports.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **`@taladb/react-native` — Float32Array zero-copy fast path** — `findNearest` now accepts a `Float32Array` directly via JSI `ArrayBuffer` introspection, bypassing JSON serialisation entirely. Eliminates the per-call f64→f32 conversion loop for large embeddings (768 / 1024 / 1536 dimensions). Falls back to `number[]` automatically for callers that pass plain arrays.

- **`@taladb/react-native` — async vector search + full-scan** — two new JSI methods dispatched to background OS threads via a `TalaDbJob` handle:
  - `findNearestAsync(collection, field, query, topK, filter?)` → `Promise<Array>` — runs HNSW / flat ANN search off the JS thread; avoids dropping frames during large unfiltered scans.
  - `findAsync(collection, filter?)` → `Promise<Array>` — full collection scan on a background thread; keeps the JS thread responsive for paginated or unbounded queries.
  - Both return native Promises polled via `setImmediate` — no CallInvoker plumbing required, compatible with Hermes and JSC without changes to the Android or iOS module layer.

- **`@taladb/node` — Float32Array zero-copy fast path** — new `findNearestF32(field, query: Float32Array, topK, filter?)` method on `CollectionNode`. Passes the underlying `f32` slice directly to `Collection::find_nearest` without allocating a conversion buffer.

- **`@taladb/node` — async variants via napi `AsyncTask`** — two new methods that run on the libuv thread pool:
  - `findNearestAsync(field, query: Float32Array, topK, filter?)` → `Promise<Array<{ document, score }>>` — offloads ANN search to a worker thread; resolves on the JS thread.
  - `findAsync(filter?)` → `Promise<Array>` — offloads full collection scan; useful for large datasets where blocking the event loop would be noticeable.

- **Vector index management — React Native** — `createVectorIndex`, `dropVectorIndex`, and `upgradeVectorIndex` are now exposed through the JSI HostObject and declared in the TurboModule Codegen spec (`NativeTalaDB.ts`). Supports `flat` and `hnsw` index types; `opts` accepts `{ metric, m, efConstruction }`.

[0.7.4]: https://github.com/thinkgrid-labs/taladb/compare/v0.7.3...v0.7.4

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **`db.compact()`** — on-demand WAL compaction, exposed across every platform layer. Call during idle periods after bulk deletes or tombstone pruning to reclaim disk space.
  - **`taladb-core`** — `StorageBackend::compact()` default no-op + `RedbBackend` implementation calling `redb::Database::compact()`. `Database::compact()` public method re-exported from the crate root. `Arc<Mutex<Database>>` wrapping ensures safe `&mut self` access without holding the lock across transaction lifetimes.
  - **`@taladb/web`** — `WorkerDB.compact()` wasm-bindgen method; `'compact'` op dispatched in the SharedWorker. OPFS-specific imports (`FileSystemSyncAccessHandle`, `openWithOpfs`, `openWithConfigAndOpfs`) gated behind new `cf-workers` Cargo feature so the Cloudflare Workers WASM build is free of browser-only web-sys bindings.
  - **`@taladb/node`** — `TalaDBNode.compact()` napi binding.
  - **`@taladb/react-native`** — `taladb_compact(handle)` C FFI function; `"compact"` property dispatched from `TalaDBHostObject`; declared in `taladb.h`.
  - **`taladb`** — `compact(): Promise<void>` added to the `TalaDB` interface and wired in all four adapter return objects (browser worker, Node.js, React Native, in-memory fallback).

- **`@taladb/cloudflare`** — new package: TalaDB adapter for Cloudflare Workers Durable Objects.
  - Runs the existing `@taladb/web` WASM core in in-memory mode (no OPFS required); state is persisted as a binary snapshot via Durable Objects `storage.put('__taladb_snapshot__')` between requests.
  - `openDurableDB(storage)` — open a TalaDB-compatible database from `this.ctx.storage`; restores from the last saved snapshot on cold-start / hibernation wake-up.
  - `CloudflareDB` — full TalaDB-compatible handle with `collection()`, `flush()`, `compact()`, and `close()`.
  - `TalaDBDurableObject` — base class; extend and export from your Worker. Provides `getDB()` (lazy init, cached for isolate lifetime) and a default `fetch()` override point.
  - `createVectorIndex` throws a clear error when `indexType === 'hnsw'` (requires native threads unavailable in Workers).
  - Full TypeScript declarations (`index.d.ts`).

- **Bun native module support** — `@taladb/node` now works on Bun out of the box via Bun's built-in N-API compatibility layer. No separate `bun:ffi` package needed — install `@taladb/node` and use it identically to Node.js. Added `"bun": ">=1.0"` to `engines`. Added Linux ARM64 (`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`) and Intel Mac (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) prebuilt targets alongside the existing ones.

- **`taladb studio` — local web UI** — new `taladb studio <file>` CLI command that starts a local HTTP server and opens a browser-based database explorer.
  - Collections listed in the sidebar with live document counts.
  - Paginated document table (50 per page) with dynamic column detection across all unique fields in the current page.
  - Client-side search bar — filters the current page by full-document JSON substring match with no round-trip.
  - Click any row to open a detail panel showing the full pretty-printed document JSON.
  - Delete documents from the row action or the detail panel (with confirmation).
  - `--port <n>` (default `4321`) and `--no-open` flags.
  - Built with `tiny_http` (sync, no Tokio runtime) and a single embedded HTML file — no external assets, no bundler. The binary is fully self-contained.

- **Zod / Valibot schema validation** — optional runtime type safety for `Collection<T>`. Pass a `schema` option to `db.collection()` to validate documents before insert.
  - Compatible with Zod (`z.object(…)`), Valibot, or any object with `parse(data: unknown): T`.
  - Validates on `insert` and `insertMany`; optionally on `find` / `findOne` via `validateOnRead: true`.
  - Throws `TalaDbValidationError` (exported from `taladb`) with the context label (`insert`, `insertMany[2]`) and the original schema library error as `cause`.
  - Collections without a `schema` option are unchanged — zero overhead.
  - `@taladb/cloudflare` exposes the same `schema` option and exports its own `TalaDbValidationError`.

[0.7.3]: https://github.com/thinkgrid-labs/taladb/compare/v0.7.2...v0.7.3

## [Unreleased] — 0.7.2

### Added

- **`rekey(backend, old_key, new_key)`** (`encryption` feature) — rotate the AES-GCM-256 encryption key on a live database without a full export/import cycle. Iterates every table in the raw backend, decrypts each value with `old_key`, and re-encrypts with `new_key` in an atomic transaction per table. Returns the count of re-encrypted values. Passing the wrong `old_key` fails immediately with `TalaDbError::Encryption`. Re-exported from the crate root as `taladb_core::rekey`.

- **`Collection::with_field_encryption(fields, key)`** (`encryption` feature) — per-field AES-GCM-256 encryption. Listed field values are encrypted before storage (using `field:<name>` as AAD so ciphertexts cannot be transplanted between fields) and decrypted transparently on all read paths (`find`, `find_with_options`, `find_one`). All other fields remain in plaintext and fully indexable. Encrypted fields are stored as `Value::Bytes` and cannot be queried by value.

- **`Collection::with_audit_log(caller)`** — opt-in append-only audit log. After every successful mutation (`insert`, `insert_many`, `update_one`, `update_many`, `delete_one`, `delete_many`) an entry is written to the `_audit` table containing: `collection`, `op` (`"insert"` | `"update"` | `"delete"`), `doc_id`, `ts` (ms since Unix epoch), and the `caller` identity string supplied by the application. No update or delete API exists for audit records. Read with `taladb_core::read_audit_log(backend, collection_filter, op_filter)`.

- **`read_audit_log(backend, collection_filter, op_filter)`** — scan the `_audit` table and return `Vec<AuditEntry>`, optionally filtered by collection name and/or operation type. Returns entries in ULID insertion order.

- **`AuditEntry`**, **`AuditOp`** — public types for working with audit log entries, re-exported from the crate root.

## [Unreleased] — 0.7.1

### Added

- **Query timeouts** — `FindOptions` has a new optional `timeout: Option<std::time::Duration>` field. When set, `find_with_options` checks elapsed time between candidate documents and returns `Err(TalaDbError::QueryTimeout)` if the deadline is exceeded. No-op when `None` (default). Bindings for WASM, Node.js, and React Native surface this as a `"QueryTimeout"` error code.

- **`TalaDbError::QueryTimeout` variant** — new error variant returned when a query exceeds its configured timeout.

- **`tracing` spans on heavy operations** — `Collection::find`, `Collection::find_with_options`, `Collection::find_nearest`, and `Database::export_snapshot` are now annotated with `#[tracing::instrument]`. Operators using an OpenTelemetry or Jaeger subscriber will see per-call spans with `collection` and `top_k` fields automatically.

- **Fuzz targets** (`packages/taladb-core/fuzz/`) — two `cargo-fuzz` targets added:
  - `fuzz_snapshot`: feeds arbitrary bytes into `Database::restore_from_snapshot` to catch panics in the snapshot parser.
  - `fuzz_filter`: deserializes arbitrary bytes as `Document` and runs filter evaluation, catching deserialization and matching panics.
    Run with `cargo fuzz run fuzz_snapshot` from `packages/taladb-core/`.

## [Unreleased] — 0.7.0

### Breaking Changes

- **`Database::collection()` now returns `Result<Collection, TalaDbError>`** instead of `Collection`. Call sites must handle the error with `?` (in functions returning `Result`) or `.unwrap()` (in tests). Returns `TalaDbError::InvalidName` if the name is empty, longer than 128 characters, or contains `"::"`.

- **Encrypted data format v0 is unreadable by `>= 0.6.2`**. Any database encrypted before `0.6.2` (without the version byte and AAD binding) must be migrated with the new `migrate_encrypted_v0_to_v1` helper before the upgrade can be completed.

### Added

- **`migrate_encrypted_v0_to_v1(backend, key)`** — one-time migration helper for databases encrypted before `0.6.2`. Reads every stored value using the old format (`[12-byte nonce][ciphertext]`, no AAD), re-encrypts it with the current v1 format (version byte + AAD binding), and writes the result back atomically per table. Returns the count of values re-encrypted. Requires the `encryption` feature.

- **Collection name validation at handle construction** — `Database::collection()` now validates the name eagerly (empty, >128 chars, contains `"::"`), surfacing errors at handle creation time rather than silently at index creation time. Also adds a 128-character maximum length check.

- **`tracing` crate integration** — all internal `eprintln!` calls replaced with structured `tracing::warn!` / `tracing::error!` calls. Operators can now route TalaDB diagnostics through any `tracing` subscriber (JSON stdout, OpenTelemetry, Datadog). Zero overhead when no subscriber is installed.

- **HTTP sync bounded thread pool** — `HttpSyncHook` no longer spawns a new OS thread per write event. A fixed pool of 4 background workers shares a bounded channel (capacity 256). Events are dropped with a `tracing::warn!` when the pool is saturated, rather than spawning unbounded threads. Each worker creates its own `reqwest::blocking::Client` to avoid the "cannot drop runtime in async context" panic in tokio test environments.

- **Snapshot size guard** — `Database::restore_from_snapshot()` now rejects inputs larger than 10 GiB, preventing OOM conditions from corrupted or crafted snapshots.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Auto `_changed_at` stamping** — every `insert`, `insertMany`, `updateOne`, and `updateMany` now automatically sets `_changed_at` to the current wall-clock time. Developers no longer need to call `stamp()` manually. `insert_with_id` (used by the sync adapter to import remote documents) is intentionally exempt so remote timestamps are never overwritten.

- **`_changed_at` secondary index** — the first mutating call on any collection automatically creates a secondary B-tree index on `_changed_at`. `export_changes` now uses an index range scan (`Filter::Gt`) instead of a full table scan, reducing export cost from O(N) to O(log N + results).

- **Delete tombstones** — `delete_one`, `delete_many`, and `delete_by_id` now write a timestamped tombstone entry to a per-collection `tomb::<name>` table after every hard delete. `export_changes` includes tombstone entries in the returned changeset so deletions propagate correctly to remote replicas that poll after the delete occurred. `import_changes` writes tombstones locally on receipt so they can be forwarded to further downstream peers.

- **`tomb_table_name(collection)` helper** — new public function in `taladb-core::index` returning the `"tomb::<name>"` table name; used internally by the sync adapter and tombstone compaction.

- **`Collection::compact_tombstones(before_ms)`** — prune tombstones older than `before_ms` (milliseconds since Unix epoch) from a collection. Returns the count of entries removed. Call periodically once all replicas are known to have received older deletions.

- **`WorkerDB::compactTombstones(collection, beforeMs)`** — Wasm binding for tombstone compaction, dispatched as the `compactTombstones` op in the Worker.

- **Bidirectional sync changeset API** — `WorkerDB::exportChangeset(collectionsJson, sinceMs)` and `WorkerDB::importChangeset(changesetJson)` are now exposed as `#[wasm_bindgen]` methods and as `exportChangeset` / `importChangeset` Worker ops. Enables pull-based sync over any transport (fetch polling, WebSocket, SSE) without baking a transport into the library. Uses `LastWriteWins` with ULID tie-breaking for deterministic merge.

- **`WorkerDB::listCollections()`** — returns a JSON array of all collection names in the database. Used internally by the secondary-tab write relay; also available to application code via the `listCollections` Worker op.

- **Secondary-tab write propagation** — writes on a non-primary (IndexedDB-fallback) tab are now relayed to the primary (OPFS) tab automatically. After every mutating op, a fallback tab exports a delta changeset and posts it on the `BroadcastChannel`. The primary tab calls `importChangeset`, merges the changes into OPFS via Last-Write-Wins, and broadcasts `taladb:changed` so all tabs stay consistent. No application code required.

- **Debounced IDB snapshot** — the IndexedDB fallback path previously flushed a full snapshot after every single write. Flushes are now debounced: the write fires after 500 ms of idle or at most every 5 s under continuous load. `db.close()` performs a synchronous flush before releasing the Web Lock so no writes are lost on tab close.

- **`Changeset`, `LastWriteWins`, `SyncAdapter` re-exported** — these types are now re-exported from the `taladb-core` crate root alongside the existing `SyncHook` / `SyncEvent` re-exports.

- **`Database::backend()`** — new `pub(crate)` accessor returning the raw `&dyn StorageBackend`; used by the sync adapter to read/write tombstone tables directly without going through the collection API.

### Fixed

- **`import_changes` applied count for missing deletes** — `ChangeOp::Delete` previously incremented `applied` unconditionally, causing `import_delete_nonexistent_returns_zero` to fail. The tombstone is still written (so the deletion can be forwarded) but `applied` only increments when the document actually existed locally.

- **`export_changes_returns_docs_after_since_ms` test** — the test constructed documents with controlled `_changed_at` values by calling `stamp()` then overriding the field before passing to `col.insert()`. Auto-stamping inside `insert()` silently discarded the override. The test now uses `Document::new` + `col.insert_with_id` (the import path) to plant documents with precise timestamps.

### Docs

- **`web.md` fully rewritten** — restructured to reflect all new capabilities: multi-tab behaviour section with ASCII flow diagram, bidirectional sync section with fetch-polling example, tombstone management with `compactTombstones` usage, conflict resolution explanation. Limitations section updated: secondary-tab writes no longer listed as a hard limitation; snapshot size ceiling and HNSW threading constraint documented accurately.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **HTTP push sync** — event-driven, webhook-style sync that pushes mutation events from the database to a remote server over HTTP:
  - `taladb.config.json` / `taladb.config.ts` support — configure `sync.pushEndpoint`, `sync.authToken`, and `sync.retryPolicy` per project
  - `SyncHook` trait implementation — every `insert`, `updateOne`, `updateMany`, `deleteOne`, `deleteMany` emits a typed `SyncEvent` to a background dispatcher
  - **Browser / WASM** — `SyncConfig` wired into the WASM worker; mutations are dispatched from `worker_db.rs` via `fetch()` on the worker thread; no main-thread blocking
  - **Node.js** — `loadConfig` / `validateConfig` read the project config file at startup and wire the sync hook into the native module
  - **React Native** — `TalaDBModule.initialize({ pushEndpoint, authToken })` passes sync config to the JSI layer at runtime; no config file needed
  - Configurable retry policy: exponential back-off with jitter, configurable `maxRetries` and `initialDelayMs`
  - `SyncEvent` payload includes `collection`, `operation`, `documentId`, `timestamp`, and the full document diff
  - CLI: `taladb sync status` shows pending event queue depth and last-push timestamp

### Fixed

- **Android `TalaDBModule` — wrong library loaded** — `System.loadLibrary("taladb_ffi")` loaded the raw Rust crate which has no JNI entrypoints; corrected to load `taladb_ffi` then `taladb_jsi`
- **Android `TalaDBModule` — wrong JSI runtime pointer** — `jsCallInvokerHolder.nativeCallInvoker` returns a `CallInvoker*`, not a `jsi::Runtime*`; fixed to `reactContext.javaScriptContextHolder!!.get()`
- **iOS podspec — static library replaced with XCFramework** — `s.vendored_libraries = "libtaladb_ffi.a"` replaced with `s.vendored_frameworks = "TalaDBFfi.xcframework"` to support both device and Apple Silicon simulator slices; CI now builds three targets (`aarch64-apple-ios`, `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`, `x86_64-apple-ios`) and packages them via `xcodebuild -create-xcframework`
- **Clippy: wasm32-only imports in `worker_db.rs`** — `HashMap`, `Arc`, `SyncEvent`, `SyncHook`, and related types were declared at crate level but only used inside `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` blocks; moved behind matching `#[cfg]` guards to fix unused-import warnings in the CI `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` check
- **Browser bundle — `js-yaml` import error** — `taladb`'s `config.ts` pulled in `js-yaml`, `node:fs`, and `node:path`; Vite statically analysed these even behind runtime guards and threw at startup. Fixed with a separate browser build entry (`index.browser.mjs`) that substitutes a no-op `config.browser.ts` stub via an esbuild plugin; the `browser` export condition in `package.json` ensures Vite resolves this path automatically
- **Playground `browser` export condition not applied** — `dev-playground.sh` copied `dist/` but not `package.json`, so the playground's `node_modules/taladb` still resolved `index.mjs` (the Node build) instead of `index.browser.mjs`; fixed by also copying `package.json`

### Improved

- **`web.md` browser support table** — updated to reflect the actual DedicatedWorker + Web Locks architecture: OPFS is the primary fast path; IndexedDB snapshot fallback activates immediately via `{ ifAvailable: true }` (no blocking wait); secondary tabs are live-synced via `BroadcastChannel`
- **`react-native.md`** — HTTP push sync section added; removed stale "not yet published to npm" limitation (package is live at `@taladb/react-native@0.5.0`); dropped `x86` ABI from Android build matrix (no current-generation device or emulator requires it)
- **Android NDK version pinned** — CI now installs NDK `27.2.12479018` explicitly via `setup-android`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **`@taladb/react` — React hooks package** — first-party hooks for live-updating queries in React and React Native:
  - `TalaDBProvider` / `useTalaDB` — context provider for the `TalaDB` instance
  - `useCollection<T>(name)` — returns a stable, memoised `Collection<T>` from context; safe to pass directly to `useFind` / `useFindOne` without wrapping in `useMemo`
  - `useFind<T>(collection, filter?)` — subscribes to a live query; returns `{ data: T[], loading: boolean }` and re-renders automatically on every matching write
  - `useFindOne<T>(collection, filter)` — same as `useFind` but returns the first matching document (`data: T | null`)
  - All hooks are backed by `useSyncExternalStore` for zero-tearing snapshots in concurrent React
  - Inline filter objects (e.g. `{ active: true }`) are serialised to a string key internally — no re-subscription on every render
  - Works in React (browser + Node.js) and React Native with identical API; no platform-specific code required
  - Full TypeScript generics — `data` is correctly typed as `T[]` / `T | null` from the document interface
  - Install: `pnpm add taladb @taladb/web @taladb/react` (browser) or `pnpm add taladb @taladb/react-native @taladb/react` (React Native)

### Infrastructure

- CI `ts-check` job now type-checks `@taladb/react` alongside `taladb`
- CI `build-taladb-react` job runs unit + integration tests (52 cases) then builds and verifies `dist/` before publish
- Release workflow publishes `@taladb/react` to npm as part of the standard release pipeline

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Full-text search index** — `collection.createFtsIndex(field)` builds an inverted token index on any string field. `$contains` queries now use a `FtsScan` plan (O(1) token lookup) instead of a `FullScan` (O(n) document scan). Drop with `dropFtsIndex(field)`. Backfills existing documents on creation.
- **HNSW vector index** — `createVectorIndex(field, { indexType: 'hnsw', hnswM?, hnswEfConstruction? })` builds a Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph for approximate nearest-neighbour search. Significantly faster than flat brute-force on large collections. Upgrade an existing flat index in-place with `upgradeVectorIndex(field)`. Available on Node.js and React Native; browser WASM now throws a clear error (requires native threads via `rayon`).
- **`listIndexes()` API** — `await collection.listIndexes()` returns `{ btree: string[], fts: string[], vector: string[] }` describing every index currently on the collection. Available on all three runtimes.
- **Query planner plans** — the query engine now selects from four execution strategies: `FullScan` (no usable index), `IndexScan` (B-tree, O(log n)), `FtsScan` (inverted FTS index, O(1)), and `IndexOr` (sorted-merge union of index scans, zero duplicates).

### Fixed

- **`createFtsIndex` idempotency** — previously returned `Err(IndexExists)` when called on a collection that already had the index. Now returns `Ok(())` (no-op), matching the behaviour of `createIndex` and `createVectorIndex`.
- **`$contains` missing from WASM filter parsers** — the `$contains` operator was not handled in `worker_db.rs` or `lib.rs`, causing every `find({ field: { $contains: ... } })` call in the browser to return `Error: invalid filter`. Added to both parsers.
- **`Update` enum missing `Clone` derive** — `updateMany` called `update.clone()` internally but `Update` did not derive `Clone`, causing a compile error surfaced by a full incremental rebuild. Fixed with `#[derive(Clone)]`.
- **Multi-tab OPFS deadlock** — a second browser tab would block indefinitely waiting for the OPFS Web Lock held by the first tab. Fixed with `{ ifAvailable: true }` — the second tab now falls back to an IndexedDB-backed in-memory database immediately and stays live-synced via `BroadcastChannel`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Sync correctness** — `LastWriteWins` adapter was using `Filter::Eq("_id", ...)` to look up existing documents, which never matched because `_id` is not a document field. Every sync operation incorrectly inserted duplicates instead of updating. Fixed by adding `find_by_id`, `delete_by_id`, and `insert_with_id` methods and routing sync through them.
- **Panic on corrupted storage keys** — vector search and snapshot parsing used `.unwrap()` on byte slice conversions after bounds checks. Replaced with proper error propagation (`InvalidSnapshot`) and graceful `continue` on malformed vector table keys.
- **Encryption stubs panicked instead of returning `Err`** — calling any encryption function without the `encryption` feature compiled in caused a `panic!`. Now returns `Err(TalaDbError::Encryption(...))` so callers can handle it.
- **Watch backpressure indistinguishable from disconnect** — `WatchRegistry::notify()` silently dropped slow subscribers. Added `TalaDbError::WatchBackpressure` variant; full-channel drops now log a warning and use the new variant, distinguishable from `WatchClosed` (channel disconnected).
- **Unnecessary `unwrap` in f32 vector decode** — `decode_f32_vec` used `c.try_into().unwrap()` inside `chunks_exact(4)`. Replaced with direct byte indexing `[c[0], c[1], c[2], c[3]]`.

### Improved

- **Index metadata cache** — `insert`, `update_one`, `update_many`, `delete_one`, `delete_many` previously loaded index metadata (regular, FTS, vector) from redb on every call (3 table scans per write). Metadata is now cached in a `Mutex<Option<CachedIndexes>>` on the `Collection` and invalidated only when indexes are created or dropped.
- **`IndexOr` query plan** — previously loaded full documents from each OR branch before deduplicating by ID. Now collects ULIDs first, deduplicates, then fetches documents once.
- **FTS `$contains` filter** — query string was tokenized once per document evaluated. Tokens are now computed once before the document loop.
- **Consistent error shapes across adapters** — WASM now returns `{error, code}` JSON objects; Node.js errors are prefixed with the variant name; React Native FFI exposes `taladb_last_error()` to retrieve the last error message from C/C++.
- **`apply_update` key allocations** — `$set`, `$push`, `$pull` operations now move field name strings instead of cloning them.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Vector index (flat search)** — hybrid document + vector database support
  - `Collection::create_vector_index(field, dimensions, metric?)` — register a vector index on any numeric-array field; backfills existing documents automatically
  - `Collection::drop_vector_index(field)` — remove a vector index and all stored vectors
  - `Collection::find_nearest(field, query, top_k, pre_filter?)` — flat (brute-force) cosine / dot / euclidean similarity search; optional metadata pre-filter lets you combine regular NoSQL filtering with vector ranking in one call
  - `VectorMetric` enum: `Cosine` (default), `Dot`, `Euclidean`
  - `VectorSearchResult { document, score }` return type
  - Vector data stored in dedicated `vec::<collection>::<field>` redb tables (raw f32 LE bytes, keyed by ULID); kept in sync with insert / update / delete
  - Full bindings across all three runtimes: `@taladb/web` (WASM + SharedWorker), `@taladb/node` (napi-rs), `@taladb/react-native` (JSI)
  - TypeScript: `createVectorIndex`, `dropVectorIndex`, `findNearest` on `Collection<T>`; new exported types `VectorMetric`, `VectorIndexOptions`, `VectorSearchResult<T>`
  - New error variants: `VectorIndexNotFound`, `VectorDimensionMismatch`

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- CI: removed `publish-crates` job so GitHub Release is no longer blocked by crates.io

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
