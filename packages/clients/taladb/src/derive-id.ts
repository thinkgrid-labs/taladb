/**
 * Deterministic document ids for replicated rows.
 *
 * The engine assigns ULIDs and **ignores a caller-supplied `_id`** — it silently
 * becomes an ordinary field, so `find({ _id: 'sku-1' })` then matches nothing.
 * That leaves a document replicated from a remote origin with no stable local
 * identity to merge on: re-fetching the same row would insert a duplicate.
 *
 * Hashing the origin's primary key into the ULID gives that identity back. The
 * same `(collection, key)` always maps to the same document, which is what makes
 * replication upserts **idempotent** (re-applying a page is a no-op), **resumable**
 * (a bootstrap walk can restart mid-way), and **safe to run concurrently** (an
 * on-demand fetch and the background walk can touch the same row and converge on
 * one document rather than two).
 *
 * ## This must stay byte-identical to the Rust `derive_doc_id`
 *
 * The same rows are addressed from both sides. If the two implementations ever
 * disagree, two clients assign different `_id`s to the same remote row and the
 * replica silently forks into duplicates — with no error anywhere. The shared
 * test vectors in `derive-id.test.ts` and `packages/core/src/document.rs` exist to
 * make that impossible to do by accident; keep them in lockstep.
 *
 * FNV-1a is used over a stronger hash precisely *because* it is short enough to
 * port between the two languages without ambiguity. It is non-cryptographic, which
 * is fine here: the input is a primary key from an origin the client already
 * trusts, not adversarial input.
