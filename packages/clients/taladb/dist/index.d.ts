 * That leaves a document replicated from a remote origin with no stable local
 * identity to merge on: re-fetching the same row would insert a duplicate.

 * one document rather than two).
 *
 * ## This must stay byte-identical to the Rust `derive_doc_id`
 *
 * The same rows are addressed from both sides. If the two implementations ever
 * disagree, two clients assign different `_id`s to the same remote row and the
 * replica silently forks into duplicates — with no error anywhere. The shared
 * test vectors in `derive-id.test.ts` and `packages/core/src/document.rs` exist to
 * make that impossible to do by accident; keep them in lockstep.
 *
 * FNV-1a is used over a stronger hash precisely *because* it is short enough to
