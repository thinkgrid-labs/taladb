//! Sync adapter interface for TalaDB.
//!
//! Defines the `SyncAdapter` trait and a built-in `LastWriteWins` (LWW)
//! implementation. A sync adapter is responsible for:
//!
//! 1. **Exporting** a changeset — the set of document mutations since a given
//!    logical clock / version vector.
//! 2. **Importing** a remote changeset — merging foreign mutations into the
//!    local database according to a conflict resolution policy.
//!
//! The adapter sits *above* the storage engine and works through the public
//! `Collection` API, so it is storage-agnostic.
//!
//! Changeset format
//! ----------------
//! A `Changeset` is a `Vec<Change>` where each `Change` records:
//! - The collection name
//! - The document ULID (ID)
//! - The operation (Upsert / Delete)
//! - A `u64` wall-clock timestamp (milliseconds since Unix epoch)
//! - The full document body (for Upserts)
//!
//! Last-Write-Wins conflict resolution
//! ------------------------------------
//! `LastWriteWins` merges by comparing `changed_at` timestamps. The change
//! with the higher timestamp wins. Equal-timestamp upserts are broken by
//! comparing the serialized document bytes (greater bytes win) — a symmetric
//! comparison every replica resolves identically, ensuring convergence
//! without coordination. Deletes win ties against upserts.
