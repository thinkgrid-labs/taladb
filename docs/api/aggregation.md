# Aggregation

`collection.aggregate(pipeline)` runs a MongoDB-style pipeline **inside the engine**, so summaries are computed in Rust over the B-tree instead of loading every document into JavaScript. A pipeline is an array of stages; each stage transforms the stream of documents produced by the previous one.

```ts
const byStatus = await orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: { $ne: 'draft' } } },
  { $group: { _id: '$status', total: { $sum: '$amount' }, n: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { total: -1 } },
])
// → [{ _id: 'paid', total: 4820, n: 37 }, { _id: 'pending', total: 910, n: 6 }]
```

## TypeScript type

```ts
type AggregatePipeline<T extends Document = Document> = AggregateStage<T>[]

aggregate<R = Document>(pipeline: AggregatePipeline<T>): Promise<R[]>
```

The result type `R` is unconstrained — aggregation produces new shapes (grouped keys, computed fields), so you pass the shape you expect:

```ts
type Row = { _id: string; total: number; n: number }
const rows = await orders.aggregate<Row>([/* … */])
```

## Stages

| Stage | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `$match` | Keep only documents matching a [filter](/api/filters). Uses an index when it is the first stage. |
| `$group` | Group documents by a key and compute accumulators per group. |
| `$sort` | Order documents. `1` ascending, `-1` descending. |
| `$skip` | Drop the first *n* documents. |
| `$limit` | Keep at most *n* documents. |
| `$project` | Choose which fields to keep. Truthy value keeps a field. |

### `$match`

Takes the same [filter](/api/filters) object as `find`. When `$match` is the **first** stage, the query planner uses an index if one is available, so filtering happens before any documents are materialised.

```ts
{ $match: { status: 'active', amount: { $gte: 100 } } }
```

### `$group`

`_id` defines the grouping key. Use a field reference (`'$field'`) to group by that field, or `null` to aggregate the whole stream into a single group. Every other key is an accumulator whose value names the operation.

```ts
{ $group: {
    _id: '$customerId',
    spent: { $sum: '$amount' },
    orders: { $sum: 1 },       // count — $sum of the constant 1
    avgOrder: { $avg: '$amount' },
    firstSeen: { $min: '$createdAt' },
} }
```

The output document of each group has `_id` set to the group key plus one field per accumulator.

#### Accumulators

| Accumulator | Result |
|---|---|
| `{ $sum: '$field' }` | Sum of the field across the group |
| `{ $sum: 1 }` | Count of documents in the group |
| `{ $count: {} }` | Count of documents in the group |
| `{ $avg: '$field' }` | Mean of the field |
| `{ $min: '$field' }` | Minimum value |
| `{ $max: '$field' }` | Maximum value |
| `{ $first: '$field' }` | Field of the first document in the group |
| `{ $last: '$field' }` | Field of the last document in the group |
| `{ $push: '$field' }` | Array of the field's values, in order |
| `{ $addToSet: '$field' }` | Array of the field's distinct values |

### `$sort`, `$skip`, `$limit`

```ts
{ $sort: { total: -1, name: 1 } }   // total desc, then name asc
{ $skip: 20 }
{ $limit: 10 }
```

### `$project`

Reshape each document. A projection is either an **inclusion** or an **exclusion** — not both.

```ts
{ $project: { name: 1, city: 1 } }   // inclusion — keep ONLY these fields
{ $project: { description: 0 } }     // exclusion — keep everything EXCEPT this
```

`_id` is kept unless you set `_id: 0`, and that is the one exclusion allowed to sit alongside an inclusion:

```ts
{ $project: { total: 1, _id: 0 } }   // fine
{ $project: { name: 1, bulky: 0 } }  // throws — mixed inclusion and exclusion
```

::: warning Changed in 0.9.3
Before 0.9.3 the engine implemented inclusion only. An exclusion such as `{ description: 0 }` parsed to an *empty inclusion list*, so every document came back stripped of every field but `_id` — silently, with no error. Exclusion now works, and mixing the two modes raises an error instead of resolving to something arbitrary.

## Paging: sort + skip + limit

A `$sort` followed by `$skip`/`$limit` is a **bounded** query, and the engine treats it as one. When the sort's first key is indexed and no `$match` precedes it, the page is served by walking that index — no document outside the page is decoded at all:

```ts
await listings.aggregate([
  { $sort: { rating: -1 } },   // `rating` is indexed
  { $skip: 0 },
  { $limit: 24 },
  { $project: { name: 1, city: 1, rating: 1 } },
]);
```

Paging a 10,000-document collection for 24 rows costs about the same as reading 24 documents, not 10,000. Multi-key sorts qualify too — only the *first* key needs an index; the rest order within the run of ties at the page boundary. Without an index on that first key the query still works, and still avoids a full sort (only the reachable `skip + limit` documents are ordered), but it must read the collection to do it.

Paging is stable: ties are broken on the unique `_id`, so a document can never appear on two pages or fall between them as `$skip` grows.

## Runtime availability

`aggregate()` is available on every runtime — Node.js, the browser (both the direct main-thread build and the OPFS worker), and React Native. The pipeline is parsed and executed inside the engine on each platform; only the transport differs (native call, WASM, worker message, or JSI).

::: tip Key ordering
`$group` accumulator fields and multi-key `$sort` are keyed from the pipeline object. Because pipelines are parsed with a `BTreeMap`, multiple keys within a single `$sort` object are applied in **alphabetical** key order, not the order you wrote them. Accumulator output names within a `$group` are unaffected — each names its own field. When multi-key sort precedence matters, prefer a single sort key whose ordering already reflects your intent.
